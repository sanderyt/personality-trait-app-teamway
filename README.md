## Personality test app for Teamway.io

Deployed app: https://personality-trait-app-teamway-9zpk62o14-sanderyt.vercel.app/

### Front-end

- TypeScript
- React (Next.js)
- Tailwind (with CSS modules & Mobile-First approach)
- Yarn as package manager

### Back-end

For mocking a back-end I have been using the Next.js API routes. This enables developers to quickly create API endpoints within the same project. For more information about this:

[Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)

To run the development server, please run:

```yarn dev```
